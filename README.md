# Note-Taking App

This is a **full-stack note-taking web application** that allows users to add, update, and manage their notes. The app provides a clean and user-friendly interface where users can create, edit, and save notes securely using a login system backed by JWT (JSON Web Token). The project is built using modern technologies such as React.js for the frontend and Node.js with Express for the backend.

## Features

- **User Authentication**: Secure login using JWT, with a registration system to create user accounts.
- **Add Notes**: Allows users to add notes with a title and description through an intuitive UI.
- **Edit Notes**: Users can update their notes after adding them using the edit functionality.
- **Persistent Storage**: Notes are saved in a backend database, accessible to the user at any time after logging in.
- **Real-time Updates**: When notes are added or updated, the dashboard refreshes automatically to reflect the changes.

## Technology Stack

### Frontend
- **React.js**: Handles the UI components and dynamic interactions.
- **Axios**: Used for making HTTP requests to the backend API.
- **CSS3**: For styling and layout.
  
### Backend
- **Node.js**: JavaScript runtime for handling backend logic.
- **Express.js**: Web framework for creating APIs.
- **JWT**: JSON Web Token for secure user authentication.
- **MongoDB**: Database for storing user notes.
